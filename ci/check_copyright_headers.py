"""Checks all files for existence of IQM copyright header.

The required copyright header is taken from a file ci/copyright_template where the year has been substituted by one of
the valid copyright years.

Paths to exclude from the copyright check can be given using --exclude-paths. These paths should be relative to the
working directory.

Usage:
    python ci/check_copyright_headers.py --exclude-paths path/to/exclude1
    path/to/exclude2.py

Exits with code -1 if files without copyright were found, exits with code 0 otherwise. Prints the names of any files
without copyright.
