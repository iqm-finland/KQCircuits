"""PCell declaration classes for chips.

Chips consist of elements, and they are elements themselves. A default chip frame is always created for chips, and
there are methods to place launchers and some test structures. After adding other elements to the chip, a ground grid
which avoids the elements can be produced.

See :mod:`.kqcircuits.elements` documentation for a general description of elements.
