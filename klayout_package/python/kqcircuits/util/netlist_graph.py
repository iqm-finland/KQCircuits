    Each element is added as a node, identified by the subcircuit id used in the netlist.
    For each node, the data dictionary contains the following items:

    * cell_name: identifies the PCell, for example ``Waveguide Coplanar$1``.
        Multiple nodes can point to the same PCell, if it has identical parameters.
    * cell_type: The PCell full name, for example ``Waveguide Coplanar``
    * location: A list [x, y] specifying the element coordinates in um.
    * instance_name: The instance name of the PCell instance, may be an empty string
    * name: A unique name for this instance. Equal to instance_name if that exists, made
        unique by appending a numbered suffix if needed. If the instance name is empty,
