def export_cell_netlist(cell, filename, pcell=None):
    """ Exports netlist into `filename` in JSON

    The file will have four sections:
    ``{"nets": {...}, "subcircuits": {...}, "circuits": {...}, "chip": {...}}``

    KLayout's `terminology <https://www.klayout.de/doc-qt5/manual/lvs_overview.html>`__ differs
    from the one used in typical EDA tools where we have components (resistors, capacitors, etc.),
    pins (the endpoints of components) and nets (i.e. wires between pins). Components are PCell
    instances, a.k.a. cells, these are called subcircuits in the netlist file.

    The main conceptual difference is that waveguides, that would be analogous to wires, are also
    treated as components. Consequently, a net in the ``nets`` section usually contains exactly two
    overlapping pins that belong to two different components each identified by a unique
    ``subcircuit_id``. One of these is almost always a waveguide. Unconnected pins are not shown
    except for Launchers.

    The ``subcircuits`` section is a dictionary of the used cells: ``<subcircuit_id>: {"cell_name":
    "...", "subcircuit_location": [<x>, <y>]}``. Where ``cell_name`` is the name of the used Element
    optionally appended with ``$<n>`` if there are more than one Elements of the same type.
    Different instances of the same cell will have different ``subcircuit_id`` but identical
    ``cell_name``.

    The ``circuits`` section maps ``cell_name`` to a dictionary of the named Element's parameters.

    If the Cell object is a Chip, the ``chip`` section contains bounding boxes of each face in the chip.
