    """Class for co-planar waveguide cross-section simulations.

    This class is intended to be subclassed by a specific simulation implementation;  The subclass should implement the
    method 'build' which defines the simulation geometry and material properties.

    Layer names in cross-section geometry don't need to obey KQC default layers. The layers use following name coding:
    - Layer name 'vacuum' is reserved for vacuum material. The vacuum layer can be left empty; then the simulation
    export fills the empty space inside the 'box' with vacuum.
    - All layers that include word 'signal' are considered as signal metals. Different signal layers are considered as
    separate signals so that the result matrices has row and column for each signal layer. The order of signals is the
    same as where they are introduced by calling 'get_sim_layer' function.
    - All layers that include word 'ground'  are considered as ground metal.
    - Any other layer is considered as dielectric. The permittivity can be set using the 'set_permittivity' function.
