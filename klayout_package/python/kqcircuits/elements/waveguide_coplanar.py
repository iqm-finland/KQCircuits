    """The PCell declaration for an arbitrary coplanar waveguide.

    Coplanar waveguide defined by the width of the center conductor and gap. It can follow any segmented lines with
    predefined bending radios. It actually consists of straight and bent PCells. Termination lengths are lengths of
    extra ground gaps for opened transmission lines

    The ``path`` parameter defines the waypoints of the waveguide. When a DPath is supplied, the waypoints can be edited
    in the KLayout GUI with the Partial tool. Alternatively, a list of DPoint can be supplied, in which case the
    guiding shape is not visible in the GUI. This is useful for code-generated (sub)cells where graphical editing is not
    possible or desired.

    Warning:
        Arbitrary angle bents can have very small gaps between bends and straight segments due to
        precision of arithmetic. Small positive value of corner_safety_overlap can avoid these gaps.
