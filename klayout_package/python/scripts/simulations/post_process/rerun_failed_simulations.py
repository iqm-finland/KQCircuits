"""
Reruns all simulations in the `input_file` main script which do not have a project_results.json file.
If no `-o outfile` argument is written, writes the new script as `input_file` with added `_rerun` suffix.

Supports both Ansys and Elmer simulations, but post processing scripts need to be run manually afterwards

Elmer simulations exported using `n_workers > 1` are run serially, but with multiple multiple MPI processes
unless an argument ``-n 1`` is provided to this script.
