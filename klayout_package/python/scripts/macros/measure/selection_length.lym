"""
Usage
=====

Select cells and object in the GUI by clicking, dragging into a box and possible holding down shift for multiselect.
Then run this macro and check the console in the macro development window for the output of this macro.

Note that
 * depending on your editor settings, you might not be able to select individual cells in a PCell: You need to turn the
 top PCell to a static cell before or tick "Pcell content is selectable" in `file/setup/application/selection`
 * depending on your editor settings, you might be able to select only the top level cells in your current
 top cell. For example, to select items in a chip, the chip would need to be the top level cell or you need to untick
 `Shallow select` in `edit/editor options/hierarchical features`.
 * the bottom bar of the main window displays the type and name of the selected item.
