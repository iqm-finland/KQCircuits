### Usage
# Select cells and object in the GUI by clicking, dragging into a box and possible holding down shift for multiselect.
# Then run this macro and check the console in the macro development window for the output of this macro.
# Note, that you cannot select individual cells in a PCell - you need to turn the top PCell to a static cell before.
