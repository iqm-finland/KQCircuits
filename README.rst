**KQCircuits** is a Python library developed by IQM for automating the design of
superconducting quantum circuits. It uses the `KLayout <https://klayout.de>`__ layout design program
API.

KQCircuits generates multi-layer 2-dimensional-geometry representing common structures in quantum
processing units (QPU). It includes definitions of parametrized geometrical objects or “elements”,
framework to easily define your own elements, framework to get geometry from the elements by setting
values to parameters and a framework to assemble a full QPU design by combining many of the elements
in different geometrical relations. Among other templates, are also structures to combine QPU
designs to create optical mask layout and EBL patterns for fabrication of quantum circuits and
export a set of files for a mask as needed for QPU fabrication.

Getting started
---------------

KQCircuits is a KLayout extension. KLayout can be used either using a graphical user interface or as
a standalone python module. KQCircuits supports both modes of operation. For the first time users,
the graphical user interface (GUI) mode is recommended.

Video tutorials for the GUI installation can be found on YouTube.

Install
^^^^^^^

KQCircuits can be used in either `Salt package <https://sami.klayout.org/>`__ or developer setup mode.
The Salt package is easier to install and try out but has some limitations.
As such, advanced users are recommended to use the developer setup below.

Easy Salt package
"""""""""""""""""

Follow the instructions in the `getting started documentation <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/start/installation.html>`__.

Developer setup
"""""""""""""""

`Install KLayout <https://www.klayout.de/build.html>`__ and run:

.. code-block:: console

   python setup_within_klayout.py

then KLayout will contain KQCircuits.
You may have to write ``python3`` or ``py`` instead of ``python`` depending on your OS and Python installation,
just make sure that the command refers to Python 3. For further details see the `developer setup
documentation <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/developer/setup.html>`__.

For stand-alone mode run

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install -e "klayout_package/python[docs,tests]"

Then scripts may be run and documentation can be built. For further details see the `documentation
<https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/developer/setup.html>`__.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for KQCircuits can be found `here <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/>`__.

It may also be generated from the sources with ``make html`` in the docs directory.

Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^

Follow the `User Guide <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/user_guide/index.html>`__ for tutorials.

Simulations
-----------

   :alt: Animation of simulations
   :width: 350

KQC currently supports exporting to **Ansys HFSS/Q3D (also with pyEPR)**, **Sonnet**, and **Elmer**.

Parameter sweeps are easy to implement, for example

.. code-block:: python

   simulations = sweep_simulation(layout, sim_class, sim_parameters, {
       'cpl_length': [160, 180, 200],
       'arm_width': [24, 28, 32, 36],
   })

exports simulations with the given individual parameters varied roughly as in the animation.

A sweep of all possible combinations between the given parameters is done by changing the function to
``cross_sweep_simulation``.
Check `klayout_package/python/scripts/simulations <https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits/tree/main/klayout_package/python/scripts/simulations>`__
for example simulation exports.
